*** Theoritical 
The == is loosly equal as it make sure that they are equal in value only but not the data type and it does type coercion 
The === is strictly equal as it mke sure that they are equal in the value and the type and it does not do type coercion

*** Practical
 function converter (celsius){
return celsius * 9/5) + 32;
}
const celsuis = 28;
const fahrenheit = converter(celsuis);
console.log(fahrenheit);
